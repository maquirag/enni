# Contribution Guidelines

This project is a self-learning case study, in pursuit of learning how to 
build a modern application and getting acquainted with the open source world.
I am not a professional developer, but a hobbyist coder.

However I want to follow development best practices, such as:

* [SOLID principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID)
* [DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)
* [KISS - Keep It Simple Stupid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle)
* [Clean Code](https://medium.com/mindorks/how-to-write-clean-code-lessons-learnt-from-the-clean-code-robert-c-martin-9ffc7aef870c)
* [Clean Architecture](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-quick-introduction-to-clean-architecture-990c014448d2/)

How to follow and apply all these principles in practice,
is yet for me to discover.
And I happily welcome anyone who wants to share this experience with me,
even if you are a beginner trying to get your bearing in the open source
community.
If you are an experienced developer, then any guidance, creative criticism 
and ideas for improvement are most welcome.

## Technical Details of the Project

[Vaadin](https://vaadin.com/) is an open source Java framework designed to
build beautiful and modern web applications by using Java alone.
Front-end HTML elements are provided by Vaadin as WebComponents.
If you want to build and test the application on your own computer,
you will need:

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* Java 8 or later. I used [AdoptOpenJDK 11 with OpenJ9](https://adoptopenjdk.net/?variant=openjdk11&jvmVariant=openj9)
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* A good IDE. I recommend [IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)
* Maven build tool (IDEA has this built-in)

## Learning the Basics

Before you get started, it should be clear to you what you're getting into.

* Study the git workflow and commands, you should have a good understanding of:
  * clone
  * commit
  * branch
  * merge
* In addition to git, there are also workflows specific for GitHub:
  * fork
  * pull request
* You can follow the awesome [interactive tutorial](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github)
on GitHub to learn and practice these.
* The [Vaadin tutorials](https://vaadin.com/learn/tutorials/vaadin-quick-start) 
are the next step. Once you have installed all components of the development environment,
you can download one of the app templates from Vaadin and work through the guides
to understand how this architecture works, and how it can be customized.
